The categories are somewhat arbitrary. Where the source defines the difficulty, e.g. [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://old.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer), I use the same difficulty here. In other cases, I use this rubric:

* Easy: Taking an intro programming course at college, e.g. [COS 126 - Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall19/cos126/) is sufficient.

* Intermediate: Taking a basic data structures and algorithms class is sufficient. This class is usually the one right after the introductory one, e.g. [COS 226 - Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall19/cos226/)

* Hard: Requires more than the basic data structures and algorithms class.
