# Description
Todays challenge will be something slightly different! Atleast I think the challenge is meant to be for today? Wait, am I meant to even be submitting today? 

Okay maybe I need some help on organising my thoughts before I submit my challenge. A to-do list would be fine, just something so that I can organise my thoughts!

It should have the following basic functionality

# Formal Inputs & Outputs
## Output description
Any output that is created should be user-friendly. When I'm viewing my to-do list, I should be able to easily discern one list item from another.

# Examples
Input:


```
addItem('Take a shower');
addItem('Go to work');
viewList();
```
Output:


```
Take a shower
Go to work
```
Further Input:


```
addItem('Buy a new phone');
deleteItem('Go to work');
viewList();
```
Outputs:


```
Take a shower
Buy a new phone
```
# Finally
Have a good challenge idea?
