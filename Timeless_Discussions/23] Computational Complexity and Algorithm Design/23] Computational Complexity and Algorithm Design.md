#  Dynamic Programming and Algorithm Design
(#WeeklyIcon)
Programming is fundamentally tied to computer science, which involves the design and optimization of algorithms to solve certain problems. In the world of "big data", tweaking and streamlining algorithms to work as quickly as possible is an important process in designing an algorithm, especially over large, inter-connected data sets.

A set of notations usually referred to as big-O notation, so named for the big letter O which is a core component of the notation (believe it or not). This notation describes how the processing time and working space grows, as the size of the input data set grows. For example, if an algorithm runs in O(f(n)) time, then the running time of the algorithm with respect to input size n grows no quicker than f(n), ignoring any constant multiples.

An example of this is sorting data (there's a pre-existing Weekly thread just on sorting here). The simple na√Øve algorithms for sorting typically run in O(n2) time in the worst-case scenario. This includes algorithms such as insertion sort. However, a bit of clever thinking allowed algorithms such as quick-sort to be developed, which uses a divide and conquer approach to make the process simpler, thereby reducing the time complexity to O(n log n) - which runs much faster when your data to be sorted is large.

We've recently had a spate of challenges which require a bit of algorithm design, so unbeknownst to you, you've already done some of this work. The specific challenges are these five; check them out if you've not already:

If you write an inefficient algorithm to solve these challenges, it might take forever to complete!

Techniques such as dynamic programming study algorithms, and specifically those that break problems down into easier-to-solve sub-problems which can be solved quicker individually than as a whole. There's also a certain class of problems (NP) for which you physically can't solve efficiently using this approach; this includes problems such as the infamous travelling salesman problem and boolean 3-SAT, for which no exact efficient solution has been found; and indeed probably won't be found.

In today's Weekly discussion, discuss anything that interests you, or that you know of, relating to algorithm design, or any interesting algorithmic approaches you took to solving any particular DailyProgrammer challenge set to date!

### Challenge Solution Order
In yesterday's challenge, we trialled ordering the solution submissions by new rather than by best. What are your opinions on this? How did you think it went? Should we make this the norm?

### IRC
We have an IRC channel on Freenode, at #reddit-dailyprogrammer. Join the channel and lurk with us!
