For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

Let's say you're taking on a larger project than usual. It spans multiple files/namespaces and requires a large variety of different components to all slot in together. What approach do you take?

I personally believe that for any large scale project, you need an OO approach, Although John Carmack did state that functional code, whilst slow in the beginning has a significant return in the long run.

What about you? How do you go about your projects?
