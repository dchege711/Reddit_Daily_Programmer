# [14) High & Low Level](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2jt5mv/weekly_14_high_low_level/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

What's your preference towards languages?

Do you like the abstracted nature of Python and Matlab where you can easily create useful programs with a relatively small line count? 

Orrrr

Do you prefer the ability to hook into low level devices and disassemble bit by bit the protocols used and create genuinely unique programs which are completely under your control?

Maybe you've found the sacred language that manages both of these without too much pain?

Discuss.
