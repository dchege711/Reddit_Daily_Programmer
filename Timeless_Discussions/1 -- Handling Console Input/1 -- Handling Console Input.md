# Weekly Topic #1
Often part of the challenges is getting the data into memory to solve the problem. A very easy way to handle it is hard code the challenge data. Another way is read from a file.

For this week lets look at reading from a console. The user entered input. How do you go about it? Posting examples of languages and what your approach is to handling this. I would suggest start a thread on a language. And posting off that language comment.

Some key points to keep in mind.

# Suggested Input to handle:
Lets read in strings. we will give n the number of strings then the strings.

## Example:

```
5
 Huey
 Dewey
 Louie
 Donald
 Scrooge
```
