Machine learning is a diverse field spanning from optimization and data classification, to computer vision and pattern recognition. Modern algorithms for detecting spam email use machine learning to react to developing types of spam and spot them quicker than people could!

Techniques include evolutionary programming and genetic algorithms, and models such as artificial neural networks. Do you work in any of these fields, or study them in academics? Do you know something about them that's interesting, or have any cool resources or videos to share? Show them to the world!

Libraries like OpenCV (available here) use machine learning to some extent, in order to adapt to new situations. The United Kingdom makes extensive use of automatic number plate recognition on speed cameras, which is a subset of optical character recognition that needs to work in high speeds and poor visibility.
