# [16) Standards and Unwritten Standards](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2lvboj/weekly_16_standards_and_unwritten_standards/)

For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

So during a challenge last week a hot topic came up about date formats. There are some standards to how dates are written to help make it easier. 

What are some common standards and perhaps unwritten standards used in programming to help make life better for everyone.
