For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

So recently there has been a massive surge in the interest of functional programming, but let's not forget the other paradigms too!

There are more than I have listed above, but how do you feel about these paradigms? 

What's a paradigm you've had interest in but not the time to explore?

What are the advantages and disadvantages of these in both development and in the real-world? 

Slightly off-topic but I would love to hear of anyone that started programming functionally versus the usual imperative/OOP route.
