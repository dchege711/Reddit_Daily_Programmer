For the original [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) post and discussion, click the link in the title.

# Weekly 11:
This topic is about what challenges you are seeking.

More or less what do you want to see. The mods read this and so this is your chance to give your input. We try to post challenges the community for the most part will enjoy doing but this feedback always helps in our choices.

thanks!
